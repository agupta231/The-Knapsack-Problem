# Project 3 - The Knapsack Problem
## Ankur Gupta
## CS2223

This program is fairly simple to run. When the program is run, it executes the `UI()` function. The `UI()` function will ask you if you want to load a file or quit the program.

Enter l to load a file
Enter q to quit

After choosing l, it will ask for the input filename. If the input file is input-1.txt, you can just press enter, and it will automatically load that file. If it is a different file, just type in the filename(assuming the file is in the root directory), and it will load the data. 

As for the search functions, they all take in 2 inputs: 
1. a 2d array of [[weights, values]] for the items to put in the knapsack
2. the capacity of the knapsack

If you have these two inputs, you should be able to run each function completely independently.
